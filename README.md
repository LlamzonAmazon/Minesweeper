# Welcome to my Mineweeper game!

The game is basically done, with small but necessary final touches inbound. It was suprisingly easy to make given my experience with C and Qt Creator's amazing features. 

A lot of the juicy code is in [<code>mainwindow.cpp</code>](mainwindow.cpp) and [<code>tile.cpp</code>](tile.cpp), should you care to take a gander.

## TODO

<ol>
  <li>Modularize mainwindow.cpp ✅</li>
  <li>Improve documentation ✅</li>
  <li>Bundle project for user-friendly use</li>
  <li>Add scoreboard</li>
  <li>Make game win scenario</li>
</ol>
