# Welcome to my Minesweeper Game!

To Do:
- Make standalone macOS and Windows builds

The game is pretty much done. This was my first project with C++ and I really liked the flexibility Qt offers. All that's left to do now is make Mac and Windows builds so you can run my game on your computer!

Most of the game logic is in <code>mainwindow.cpp</code> and <code>tile.cpp</code>.
